This tutorial serves as an introduction to using ExecuTorch to deploy PyTorch models on Arm&reg; Ethos&trade;-U targets. It is based on `ethos_u_minimal_example.ipynb`, provided in Arm’s examples folder.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need a Linux machine with aarch64 or x86_64 processor architecture, or a macOS&trade; machine with Apple&reg; Silicon.

To enable development without a specific development board, we will be using a [Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP)](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/fixed-virtual-platforms), simulating [Arm&reg; Corstone&trade;-300](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300)(cs300) and [Arm&reg; Corstone&trade;-320](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-320)(cs320)systems. Think of it as virtual hardware.

### Software

First, you will need to install ExecuTorch. Please follow the recommended tutorials to set up a working ExecuTorch development environment.

In addition to this, you need to install a number of SDK dependencies for generating Ethos-U command streams. Scripts to automate this are available in the main [ExecuTorch repository](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples/arm/).
To install Ethos-U dependencies, run
```bash
./examples/arm/setup.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula
```
This will install:
- [TOSA Serialization Library](https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa/software.html) for serializing the Exir IR graph into TOSA IR.
- [Ethos-U Vela graph compiler](https://pypi.org/project/ethos-u-vela/) for compiling TOSA flatbuffers into a Ethos-U command stream.
- [Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) for cross compilation.
- [Corstone SSE-300 FVP](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100966/1128/Arm--Corstone-SSE-300-FVP) for testing on Ethos-U55 reference design.
- [Corstone SSE-320 FVP](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109760/0000/SSE-320-FVP) for testing on Ethos-U85 reference design.

## Set Up the Developer Environment

The setup.sh script generates a setup_path.sh script that you need to source whenever you restart your shell. Run:

```{bash}
source  examples/arm/arm-scratch/setup_path.sh
```

As a simple check that your environment is set up correctly, run `which FVP_Corstone_SSE-320` and make sure that the executable is located where you expect, in the `examples/arm` tree.

## Build

### Ahead-of-Time (AOT) components

The ExecuTorch Ahead-of-Time (AOT) pipeline takes a PyTorch Model (a `torch.nn.Module`) and produces a `.pte` binary file, which is then consumed by the ExecuTorch Runtime. This [document](getting-started-architecture.md) goes in much more depth about the ExecuTorch software stack for both AoT as well as Runtime.

The example below shows how to quantize a model consisting of a single addition, and export it it through the AOT flow using the EthosU backend. For more details, see `examples/arm/ethos_u_minimal_example.ipynb`.
$MINIMAL_EXAMPLE

```{tip}
For a quick start, you can use the script `examples/arm/aot_arm_compiler.py` to produce the pte.
To produce a pte file equivalent to the one above, run
`python -m examples.arm.aot_arm_compiler --model_name=add --delegate --quantize --output=ethos_u_minimal_example.pte`
```

### Runtime:

After the AOT compilation flow is done, the runtime can be cross compiled and linked to the produced `.pte`-file using the Arm cross-compilation toolchain. This is done in two steps:

First, build and install the ExecuTorch libraries and EthosUDelegate:
```
# In ExecuTorch top-level, with sourced setup_path.sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --preset arm-baremetal -B cmake-out-arm .
cmake --build cmake-out-arm --target install -j$(nproc)
```
Second, build and link the `arm_executor_runner` and generate kernel bindings for any non delegated ops. This is the actual program that will run on target.

```
# In ExecuTorch top-level, with sourced setup_path.sh
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`pwd`/examples/arm/ethos-u-setup/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DET_PTE_FILE_PATH=ethos_u_minimal_example.pte \
      -DTARGET_CPU=cortex-m55 \
      -DETHOSU_TARGET_NPU_CONFIG=ethos-u55-128 \
      -DMEMORY_MODE=Shared_Sram \
      -DSYSTEM_CONFIG=Ethos_U55_High_End_Embedded \
      -Bethos_u_minimal_example \
      examples/arm/executor_runner
cmake --build ethos_u_minimal_example -j$(nproc) -- arm_executor_runner
```

```{tip}
For a quick start, you can use the script `backends/arm/scripts/build_executor_runner.sh` to build the runner.
To build a runner equivalent to the one above, run
`./backends/arm/scripts/build_executor_runner.sh --pte=ethos_u_minimal_example.pte`
````

The block diagram below shows, at the high level, how the various build artifacts are generated and are linked together to generate the final bare-metal executable.

## Running on Corstone FVP Platforms

Finally, use the `backends/arm/scripts/run_fvp.sh` utility script to run the .elf-file on simulated Arm hardware.
```
backends/arm/scripts/run_fvp.sh --elf=$(find ethos_u_minimal_example -name arm_executor_runner) --target=ethos-u55-128
```
The example application is by default built with an input of ones, so the expected result of the quantized addition should be close to 2.
