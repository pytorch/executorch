# Quantization

The Arm Ethos-U delegate only supports the execution of quantized models. To quantize a model so that is supported by this delegate, the `EthosUQuantizer` should be used.

Currently, the symmetric `int8` config defined by `executorch.backends.arm.quantizer.arm_quantizer.get_symmetric_quantization_config` is the main config available to use with the Ethos-U quantizer.

### Supported Quantization Schemes

The Arm Ethos-U delegate supports the following quantization schemes:

- 8-bit symmetric weights with 8-bit asymmetric activations (via the PT2E quantization flow).
- Limited support for 16-bit quantization with 16-bit activations and 8-bit weights (a.k.a 16x8 quantization). This is under development.
- Partial quantization is *not* supported on the Ethos-U backend. The entire model must be quantized.
