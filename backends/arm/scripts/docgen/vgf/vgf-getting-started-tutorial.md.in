In this tutorial you will learn how to export a simple PyTorch model for the ExecuTorch VGF backend.

```{warning}
This delegate is under active development, to get best results please use a recent version.
The VGF backend support is in early development and you may encounter issues.
You may encounter some rough edges and features which may be documented or planned but not implemented, please refer to the in-tree documentation for the latest status of features.
```

```{tip}
If you are already familiar with this delegate, you may want to jump directly to the examples:
* [Examples in the ExecuTorch repository](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples/arm)
* [A commandline compiler for example models](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/arm/aot_arm_compiler.py)
```

This tutorial serves as an introduction to using ExecuTorch to deploy PyTorch models on VGF targets. The tutorial is based on `vgf_minimal_example.ipyb`, provided in Arm's example folder.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need a Linux machine with aarch64 or x86_64 processor architecture, or a macOS&trade; machine with Apple&reg; Silicon.

To enable development without a specific development board, we will be using the [ML SDK for Vulkan&reg;](https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-sdk-for-vulkan/) to emulate the program consumer.

### Software

First, you will need to install ExecuTorch. Please follow the recommended tutorials if you haven't already, to set up a working ExecuTorch development environment. For the VGF backend it's recommended you [install from source](https://docs.pytorch.org/executorch/stable/using-executorch-building-from-source.html), or from a [nightly](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/executorch/).

In addition to this, you need to install a number of SDK dependencies for generating VGF files. Scripts to automate this are available in the main [ExecuTorch repository](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples/arm/). To install VGF dependencies, run
```bash
./examples/arm/setup.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula --disable-ethos-u-deps --enable-mlsdk-deps
```
This will install:
- [TOSA Serialization Library](https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa/software.html) for serializing the Exir IR graph into TOSA IR.
- [ML SDK Model Converter](https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-sdk-model-converter) for converting TOSA flatbuffers to VGF files.
- [Vulkan API](https://www.vulkan.org) should be set up locally for GPU execution support.
- [ML Emulation Layer for Vulkan](https://github.com/arm/ai-ml-emulation-layer-for-vulkan) for testing on Vulkan API.


## Set Up the Developer Environment

The `setup.sh` script has generated a `setup_path.sh` script that you need to source whenever you restart your shell. Do this by running

`source examples/arm/arm-scratch/setup_path.sh`

As a simple check that your environment is set up correctly, run

```bash
which model-converter
```
Make sure the executable is located where you expect, in the `examples/arm` tree. 

## Build

### Ahead-of-Time (AOT) components

The ExecuTorch Ahead-of-Time (AOT) pipeline takes a PyTorch Model (a `torch.nn.Module`) and produces a `.pte` binary file, which is then typically consumed by the ExecuTorch Runtime. This [document](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/docs/source/getting-started-architecture.md) goes in much more depth about the ExecuTorch software stack for both AoT as well as Runtime.

The example below shows how to quantize a model consisting of a single addition, and export it it through the AOT flow using the VGF backend. For more details, se `examples/arm/vgf_minimal_example.ipynb`.

$MINIMAL_EXAMPLE

```{tip}
For a quick start, you can use the script `examples/arm/aot_arm_compiler.py` to produce the pte.
To produce a pte file equivalent to the one above, run
`python -m examples.arm.aot_arm_compiler --model_name=add --delegate --quantize --output=simple_example.pte --target=vgf` 
```

### Runtime:

## Build executor runtime

After the AOT compilation flow is done, we can build the executor runner target. For this tutorial, the default runner can be used. Build it with the following configuration:

```bash
# In ExecuTorch top-level, with sourced setup_path.sh
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=cmake-out \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_DATA_LOADER=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_MODULE=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_FLAT_TENSOR=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_TENSOR=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_KERNELS_QUANTIZED=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_XNNPACK=OFF \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_VULKAN=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_VGF=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_ENABLE_LOGGING=ON \
  -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=python \
  -Bcmake-out .

cmake --build cmake-out --target executor_runner`
```


The block diagram below demonstrates, at the high level, how the various build artifacts are generated and are linked together to generate the final bare-metal executable.

## Deploying and running on device

Since we are using the Vulkan emulation layer, we can run the executor runner with the VGF delegate on the host machine:

```bash
./cmake-out/executor_runner -model_path simple_example.pte
```

The example application is by default built with an input of ones, so the expected result of the quantized addition should be close to 2.

## Takeaways

In this tutorial you have learned how to use ExecuTorch to export a PyTorch model to an executable that can run on an embedded target, and then run that executable on simulated hardware.


## FAQs

Issue: glslc is not found when configuring the executor runner.
Solution: The Vulkan sdk is likely not in your path, check whether setup_path.sh contains something like
`export PATH=$(pwd)/examples/arm/arm-scratch/vulkan_sdk/1.4.321.1/x86_64/bin:$PATH`.
If not, add it and source the file.
