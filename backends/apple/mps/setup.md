# Building and Running ExecuTorch with MPS Backend

In this tutorial we will walk you through the process of getting setup to build the MPS backend for ExecuTorch and running a simple model on it.

The MPS backend device maps machine learning computational graphs and primitives on the [MPS Graph](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshadersgraph/mpsgraph?language=objc) framework and tuned kernels provided by [MPS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders?language=objc).

## Prerequisites (Hardware and Software)

In order to be able to successfully build and run a model using the MPS backend for ExecuTorch, you'll need the following hardware and software components:

### Hardware:
 - A [mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/) for tracing the model

### Software:

  - **Ahead of time** tracing:
    - [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) 12

  - **Runtime**:
    - [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) >= 12.4
    - [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios) >= 15.4
    - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) >= 14.1

## Setting up Developer Environment

***Step 1.*** Please finish tutorial [Setting up ExecuTorch](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/getting-started-setup).

***Step 2.*** Install dependencies needed to lower MPS delegate:

  ```bash
  ./backends/apple/mps/install_requirements.sh
  ```

## Build

### AOT (Ahead-of-time) Components

**Compiling model for MPS delegate**:
- In this step, you will generate a simple ExecuTorch program that lowers MobileNetV3 model to the MPS delegate. You'll then pass this Program (the `.pte` file) during the runtime to run it using the MPS backend.

```bash
cd executorch
# Note: `mps_example` script uses by default the MPSPartitioner for ops that are not yet supported by the MPS delegate. To turn it off, pass `--no-use_partitioner`.
python3 -m examples.apple.mps.scripts.mps_example --model_name="mv3" --bundled --use_fp16

# To see all options, run following command:
python3 -m examples.apple.mps.scripts.mps_example --help
```

### Runtime

**Building the MPS executor runner:**
```bash
# In this step, you'll be building the `mps_executor_runner` that is able to run MPS lowered modules:
cd executorch
./examples/apple/mps/scripts/build_mps_executor_runner.sh
```

## Run the mv3 generated model using the mps_executor_runner

```bash
./cmake-out/examples/apple/mps/mps_executor_runner --model_path mv3_mps_bundled_fp16.pte --bundled_program
```

- You should see the following results. Note that no output file will be generated in this example:
```
I 00:00:00.003290 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:286] Model file mv3_mps_bundled_fp16.pte is loaded.
I 00:00:00.003306 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:292] Program methods: 1
I 00:00:00.003308 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:294] Running method forward
I 00:00:00.003311 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:349] Setting up non-const buffer 1, size 606112.
I 00:00:00.003374 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:376] Setting up memory manager
I 00:00:00.003376 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:392] Loading method name from plan
I 00:00:00.018942 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:399] Method loaded.
I 00:00:00.018944 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:404] Loading bundled program...
I 00:00:00.018980 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:421] Inputs prepared.
I 00:00:00.118731 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:438] Model executed successfully.
I 00:00:00.122615 executorch:mps_executor_runner.mm:501] Model verified successfully.
```

### [Optional] Run the generated model directly using pybind
1. Make sure `pybind` MPS support was installed:
```bash
./install_requirements.sh --pybind mps
```
2. Run the `mps_example` script to trace the model and run it directly from python:
```bash
cd executorch
# Check correctness between PyTorch eager forward pass and ExecuTorch MPS delegate forward pass
python3 -m examples.apple.mps.scripts.mps_example --model_name="mv3" --no-use_fp16 --check_correctness
# You should see following output: `Results between ExecuTorch forward pass with MPS backend and PyTorch forward pass for mv3_mps are matching!`

# Check performance between PyTorch MPS forward pass and ExecuTorch MPS forward pass
python3 -m examples.apple.mps.scripts.mps_example --model_name="mv3" --no-use_fp16 --bench_pytorch
```

### Profiling:
1. [Optional] Generate an [ETRecord](./etrecord.rst) while you're exporting your model.
```bash
cd executorch
python3 -m examples.apple.mps.scripts.mps_example --model_name="mv3" --generate_etrecord -b
```
2. Run your Program on the ExecuTorch runtime and generate an [ETDump](./etdump.md).
```
./cmake-out/examples/apple/mps/mps_executor_runner --model_path mv3_mps_bundled_fp16.pte --bundled_program --dump-outputs
```
3. Create an instance of the Inspector API by passing in the ETDump you have sourced from the runtime along with the optionally generated ETRecord from step 1.
```bash
python3 -m sdk.inspector.inspector_cli --etdump_path etdump.etdp --etrecord_path etrecord.bin
```

## Deploying and Running on Device

***Step 1***. Create the ExecuTorch core and MPS delegate frameworks to link on iOS
```bash
cd executorch
./build/build_apple_frameworks.sh --mps
```

`mps_delegate.xcframework` will be in `cmake-out` folder, along with `executorch.xcframework` and `portable_delegate.xcframework`:
```bash
cd cmake-out && ls
```

***Step 2***. Link the frameworks into your XCode project:
Go to project Targetâ€™s  `Build Phases`  -  `Link Binaries With Libraries`, click the **+** sign and add the frameworks: files located in  `Release` folder.
- `executorch.xcframework`
- `portable_delegate.xcframework`
- `mps_delegate.xcframework`

From the same page, include the needed libraries for the MPS delegate:
- `MetalPerformanceShaders.framework`
- `MetalPerformanceShadersGraph.framework`
- `Metal.framework`

In this tutorial, you have learned how to lower a model to the MPS delegate, build the mps_executor_runner and run a lowered model through the MPS delegate, or directly on device using the MPS delegate static library.
