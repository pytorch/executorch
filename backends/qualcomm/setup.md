# Setting up QNN Backend

Please refer to [Building and Running ExecuTorch with Qualcomm AI Engine Direct Backend](../../docs/source/backends-qualcomm.md).

That is a tutorial for building and running Qualcomm AI Engine Direct backend,
including compiling a model on a x64 host and running the inference
on a Android device.
