# WARNING: the contents of this file must BOTH be valid Starlark (for Buck) as well as
# valid Python (for our cmake build). This means that load() directives are not allowed
# (as they are not recognized by Python). If you want to fix this, figure out how run
# this file from cmake with a proper Starlark interpreter as part of the default OSS
# build process. If you need some nontrivial Starlark features, make a separate bzl
# file. (Remember that bzl files are not exported via ShipIt by default, so you may also
# need to update ExecuTorch's ShipIt config.)

# This file contains srcs lists that are shared between our Buck and CMake build
# systems. We had three choices for listing src files:
# 1) List them in Buck and use buck query to get them in CMake. This was our setup for a
# long time; the problem is that OSS users would prefer not to have to deal with Buck at
# all.
# 2) List them in both Buck targets.bzl files and CMake's CMakeLists.txt files. This is
# unnecessary duplication, and people will invariably forget to update one or the other.
# 3) List them somewhere CMake and Buck can both get at them; that's this file. Buck
# files can load() it, and our CMake build evaluates it with Python. (See
# executorch_append_filelist in build/Codegen.cmake.)
#
# Inconveniently, the Buck target layout is much more granular than the CMake library
# layout, leading to several complications:
# 1) Single-file Buck targets will just list the one src file they contain. Nothing to
# share with CMake in that case, and that src will be in a list in this file that does
# not map directly to that particular Buck target.
# 2) Multi-file Buck targets should have a list below that corresponds exactly to their
# `srcs`. There should then be simple Python code that combines those lists into lists
# that map 1:1 to the CMake library layout.
