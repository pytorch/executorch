    The subdir_glob() function is useful for defining header maps for C/C++
    libraries which should be relative the given sub-directory.
    Given a list of tuples, the form of (relative-sub-directory, glob-pattern),
    it returns a dict of sub-directory relative paths to full paths.

    Please refer to native.glob() for explanations and examples of the pattern.

    Args:
      glob_specs: The array of tuples in form of
        (relative-sub-directory, glob-pattern inside relative-sub-directory).
        type: List[Tuple[str, str]]
      exclude: A list of patterns to identify files that should be removed
        from the set specified by the first argument. Defaults to [].
        type: Optional[List[str]]
      prefix: If is not None, prepends it to each key in the dictionary.
        Defaults to None.
        type: Optional[str]

    Returns:
      A dict of sub-directory relative paths to full paths.
