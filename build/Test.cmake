# A helper function to generate a gtest cxx executable target @param
# target_name: name for the executable @param SOURCES <list_of_sources>: test
# sources to be compiled. Sometimes util sources are used as well @param EXTRA
# LIBS <list_of_libs>: additional libraries to be linked against the target.
# gtest, gmock, executorch are linked by default, but Sometimes user may need
# additional libraries like kernels. We use CMake package executorch in this
# helper, so user can easily add installed libraries.
#
# Example: et_cxx_test(my_test SOURCES my_test.cpp EXTRA_LIBS portable_kernels)
#
# This defines a gtest executable my_test, compiling my_test.cpp, and linking
# against libportable_kernels.a.
#
