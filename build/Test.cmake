# A helper function to generate a gtest cxx executable target
# @param target_name: name for the executable
# @param SOURCES <list_of_sources>: test sources to be compiled. Sometimes
# util sources are used as well
# @param EXTRA LIBS <list_of_libs>: additional libraries to be linked against
# the target. gtest, gmock, executorch are linked by default, but Sometimes
# user may need additional libraries like kernels.
# We use CMake package executorch in this helper, so user can easily add
# installed libraries.
#
# Example:
# et_cxx_test(my_test SOURCES my_test.cpp EXTRA_LIBS portable_kernels)
#
# This defines a gtest executable my_test, compiling my_test.cpp, and linking
# against libportable_kernels.a.
