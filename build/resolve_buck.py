"""
Locate or download the version of buck2 needed to build ExecuTorch.
It is intended to be invoked from the CMake build logic, and it returns
the path to 'buck2' via stdout. Log messages are written to stderr.

It uses the following logic, in order of precedence, to locate or download
buck2:

 1) If BUCK2 argument is set explicitly, use it. Warn if the version is
    incorrect.
 2) Look for a binary named buck2 on the system path. Take it if it is
    the correct version.
 3) Check for a previously downloaded buck2 binary (from step 4).
 4) Download and cache correct version of buck2.
