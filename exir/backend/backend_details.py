How to create a backend (for example, BackendWithCompilerDemo):

class BackendDetails(ABC):
    """
    A base interface to lower the implementation to the according backend. With
    the decorators, this interface will be static, abstract and all inheritances are
    enforced to implement this method.

    Args:
        edge_program: The original exported program. It will not be modified in place.
        backend_debug_handle_generator: A callable to map a graph to a dictionary (key is node, value is id)
        compile_specs: List of values needed for compilation

    Returns:
        PreprocessResult: It wraps the following information:
            processed_bytes -> bytes: A compiled blob - a binary that can run the desired program in the backend.
            debug_handle_map (Optional[Dict[int, Tuple[int]]]): For profiling purposes, a map from the node_id in the final graph (either EXIR or the user's self-defined IR)
            to debug handle id attached in the original exported program.
