+## ExecuTorch
+A unified ML software stack within the PyTorch platform for edge devices. It
+defines new compiler entry points as well as a state-of-art runtime.
+
+Home: https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/
+
+### executor_runner
+
+This test is a simple wrapper around ExecuTorch runtime, capable of running
+`.pte` model files compatible with ExecuTorch.
+
+If configured correctly with `ET_*` CMake variables pointing to the ExecuTorch
+project build, then this test bin executes `model.pte.h` file converted from
+`model.pte` using `pte_to_header.py`, from the ExecuTorch project root dir,
+containing an ExecuTorch compatible PyTorch model on the Costrone 300 FVP using
+ExecuTorch runtime.
