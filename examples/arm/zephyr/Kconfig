config EXECUTORCH_METHOD_ALLOCATOR_POOL_SIZE
	int "Method allocator pool size in bytes"
	default 16384
	depends on EXECUTORCH
	help
	  Size of the method allocator pool in bytes. This memory is used
	  for allocating ExecuTorch method instances and their metadata.
	  Default is 16KB which should be sufficient for most small models.
	  Larger models may require more memory.

config EXECUTORCH_TEMP_ALLOCATOR_POOL_SIZE
	int "Temporary allocator pool size in bytes"
	default 2048
	depends on EXECUTORCH
	help
	  Size of the temporary allocator pool in bytes. This memory is used
	  for temporary allocations during model execution such as intermediate
	  tensor calculations. Default is 2KB which should be sufficient for
	  simple operations. Complex models may require more memory.
