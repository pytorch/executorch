# Building an ExecuTorch iOS Demo App

Welcome to the tutorial on setting up the ExecuTorch iOS Demo App!

This app uses the
[MobileNet v3](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/mobilenetv3.html) model to
process live camera images leveraging three different backends:
[XNNPACK](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK),
[Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) and
[Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders)
(Xcode 15+ and iOS 17+ only).

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

### 1. Xcode 15 and Command Line Tools

Install Xcode 15 from the
[Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) and then install
the Command Line Tools using the terminal:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### 2. Python 3.10+

Python 3.10 or above, along with `pip`, should be pre-installed on MacOS 13.5+.
If needed, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) and
install it. Verify the Python and pip versions using these commands:

```bash
which python3 pip
python3 --version
pip --version
```

### 3. Getting Started Tutorial

Follow the [Setting Up ExecuTorch](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/getting-started-setup)
tutorial to configure the basic environment:

```bash
git clone -b release/0.2 https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
cd executorch
git submodule update --init

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

./install_requirements.sh --pybind coreml mps xnnpack
```

### 4. Backend Dependencies

Also, follow the corresponding sections from [Core ML](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/build-run-coreml) and
[MPS](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/build-run-mps) tutorials to install additional dependencies for those
backends:

```bash
./backends/apple/coreml/scripts/install_requirements.sh

./backends/apple/mps/install_requirements.sh
```

## Models and Labels

Now, let's move on to exporting and bundling the MobileNet v3 model.

### 1. Export Model

Export the MobileNet v3 model with Core ML, MPS and XNNPACK backends, and move
the exported model to a specific location where the Demo App will pick them up:

```bash
python3 -m examples.portable.scripts.export --model_name="mv3"
python3 -m examples.apple.coreml.scripts.export --model_name="mv3"
python3 -m examples.apple.mps.scripts.mps_example --model_name="mv3"
python3 -m examples.xnnpack.aot_compiler --delegate --model_name="mv3"

mkdir -p examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/ExecuTorchDemo/ExecuTorchDemo/Resources/Models/MobileNet/
mv mv3*.pte examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/ExecuTorchDemo/ExecuTorchDemo/Resources/Models/MobileNet/
```

### 2. Download Labels

Download the MobileNet model labels required for image classification:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt \
  -o examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/ExecuTorchDemo/ExecuTorchDemo/Resources/Models/MobileNet/imagenet_classes.txt
```

## Final Steps

We're almost done! Now, we just need to open the project in Xcode, run the
tests, and finally run the app.

### 1. Open Project in Xcode

Double-click on the project file under
`examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/ExecuTorchDemo` or run the command:

```bash
open examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/ExecuTorchDemo/ExecuTorchDemo.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Run Tests

You can run tests on Simulaltor directly in Xcode with `Cmd + U` or use the
command line:

```bash
xcrun simctl create executorch "iPhone 15"
xcodebuild clean test \
     -project examples/demo-apps/apple_ios/ExecuTorchDemo/ExecuTorchDemo.xcodeproj \
     -scheme App \
     -destination name=executorch
xcrun simctl delete executorch
```

### 3. Run App

Finally, connect the device, set up Code Signing in Xcode, and then run the app
using `Cmd + R`. Try installing a Release build for better performance.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the ExecuTorch iOS Demo App. Now,
you can explore and enjoy the power of ExecuTorch on your iOS device!
