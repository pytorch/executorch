# Building an ExecuTorch Android Demo App

This is forked from [PyTorch Android Demo App](https://github.com/pytorch/android-demo-app).

This guide explains how to setup ExecuTorch for Android using a demo app. The app employs a [DeepLab v3](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_deeplabv3_resnet101/) model for image segmentation tasks. Models are exported to ExecuTorch using [XNNPACK FP32 backend](tutorial-xnnpack-delegate-lowering.md).

## Build

### Ahead-Of-Time

We generate the model file for the ExecuTorch runtime in Android Demo App.

#### XNNPACK Delegation

For delegating DeepLab v3 to XNNPACK backend, please do the following to export the model:

```bash
python3 -m examples.xnnpack.aot_compiler --model_name="dl3" --delegate
mkdir -p examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/assets/
cp dl3_xnnpack_fp32.pte examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/assets/
```

For more detailed tutorial of lowering to XNNPACK, please see [XNNPACK backend](tutorial-xnnpack-delegate-lowering.md).

#### Qualcomm Hexagon NPU

For delegating to Qualcomm Hexagon NPU, please follow the tutorial [here](build-run-qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-backend.md).

After generating the model, copy the model to `assets` directory.

```bash
python -m examples.qualcomm.scripts.deeplab_v3 -b build_android -m SM8450 -s <adb_connected_device_serial>
cp deeplab_v3/dlv3_qnn.pte examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/assets/
```

### Runtime

We build the required ExecuTorch runtime library to run the model.

#### XNNPACK

1. Build the CMake target for the library with XNNPACK backend:

```bash
export ANDROID_NDK=<path-to-android-ndk>
export ANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a

rm -rf cmake-android-out && mkdir cmake-android-out

# Build the core executorch library
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=cmake-android-out \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="${ANDROID_NDK}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
  -DANDROID_ABI="${ANDROID_ABI}" \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_XNNPACK=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_DATA_LOADER=ON \
  -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_MODULE=ON \
  -Bcmake-android-out

cmake --build cmake-android-out -j16 --target install
```

When we set `EXECUTORCH_BUILD_XNNPACK=ON`, we will build the target [`xnnpack_backend`](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/backends/xnnpack/CMakeLists.txt) which in turn is linked into libexecutorch_jni via [CMake](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/demo-apps/android/jni/CMakeLists.txt).

2. Build the Android extension:

```bash

# Build the android extension
cmake extension/android \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="${ANDROID_NDK}"/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DANDROID_ABI="${ANDROID_ABI}" \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=cmake-android-out \
  -Bcmake-android-out/extension/android

cmake --build cmake-android-out/extension/android -j16
```

`libexecutorch_jni.so` wraps up the required XNNPACK Backend runtime library from `xnnpack_backend`, and adds an additional JNI layer using fbjni. This is later exposed to Java app.

#### Qualcomm Hexagon NPU

1. Build the CMake target for the library with Qualcomm Hexagon NPU (HTP) backend (XNNPACK also included):

```bash
export ANDROID_NDK=<path-to-android-ndk>
export ANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a
export QNN_SDK_ROOT=<path-to-qnn-sdk>

rm -rf cmake-android-out && mkdir cmake-android-out && cd cmake-android-out
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=cmake-android-out \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="${ANDROID_NDK}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
    -DANDROID_ABI="${ANDROID_ABI}" \
    -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_XNNPACK=ON \
    -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_QNN=ON \
    -DQNN_SDK_ROOT="${QNN_SDK_ROOT}" \
    -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_DATA_LOADER=ON \
    -DEXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_MODULE=ON \
    -Bcmake-android-out

cmake --build cmake-android-out -j16 --target install
```
Similar to the XNNPACK library, with this setup, we compile `libexecutorch_jni.so` but it adds an additional static library `qnn_executorch_backend` which wraps up Qualcomm HTP runtime library and registers the Qualcomm HTP backend. This is later exposed to Java app.

`qnn_executorch_backend` is built when we turn on CMake option `EXECUTORCH_BUILD_QNN`. It will include the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/backends/qualcomm/CMakeLists.txt) from backends/qualcomm where we `add_library(qnn_executorch_backend STATIC)`.

2. Build the Android extension:

```bash
cmake extension/android \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="${ANDROID_NDK}"/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DANDROID_ABI="${ANDROID_ABI}" \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=cmake-android-out \
  -Bcmake-android-out/extension/android

cmake --build cmake-android-out/extension/android -j16
```

## Deploying on Device via Demo App

### Steps for Deploying Model via XNNPACK

```bash
mkdir -p examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
cp cmake-android-out/extension/android/libexecutorch_jni.so \
   examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libexecutorch.so
```

This allows the Android app to load ExecuTorch runtime with XNNPACK backend as a JNI library. Later, this shared library will be loaded by `NativePeer.java` in Java code.

### Steps for Deploying Model via Qualcomm's AI Engine Direct

```bash
mkdir -p ../examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
```

We need to push some additional Qualcomm HTP backend libraries to the app. Please refer to [Qualcomm docs](build-run-qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-backend.md) here.

```bash
cp ${QNN_SDK_ROOT}/lib/aarch64-android/libQnnHtp.so ${QNN_SDK_ROOT}/lib/hexagon-v69/unsigned/libQnnHtpV69Skel.so ${QNN_SDK_ROOT}/lib/aarch64-android/libQnnHtpV69Stub.so ${QNN_SDK_ROOT}/lib/aarch64-android/libQnnSystem.so \
   examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
```

Copy the core libraries:

```bash
cp cmake-android-out/extension/android/libexecutorch_jni.so \
   examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libexecutorch.so
cp cmake-android-out/lib/libqnn_executorch_backend.so \
   examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libqnn_executorch_backend.so
```

## Running the App

1. Open the project `examples/demo-apps/android/ExecuTorchDemo` with Android Studio.

2. [Run](https://developer.android.com/studio/run) the app (^R).
