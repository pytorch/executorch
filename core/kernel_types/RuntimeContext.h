 * NOTE: Will not be forwarded to operators if running in ATen mode
 * as those operators do not expect to receive a RuntimeContext and would not
 * use it.
 *
 * This includes things like setting an error state, a scratch allocator for
 * operators that need more then constant space, and a TensorResizer for dynamic
 * shape tensors allowing programs to be more flexible with Tensor shape.
