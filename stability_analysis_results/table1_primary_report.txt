Latency Stability Analysis: table1 (Primary)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(coreml_fp16)
Device: Apple iPhone 15 (private)(iOS 18.0)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 10
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:49:37+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:33:28+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 1.00 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 1.00 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 0.00 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 0.00%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 0.00 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 1.00 ms
  - P90: 1.00 ms
  - P95: 1.00 ms
  - P99: 1.00 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 1.0000
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.0000
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 0.00 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 100.0/100
  - Overall stability rating: Excellent

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows excellent stability (score: 100.0/100) with very low
  variation between runs (CV: 0.00%).
  This indicates highly consistent performance suitable for latency-sensitive applications.
