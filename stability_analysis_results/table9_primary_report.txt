Latency Stability Analysis: table9 (Primary)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(xnnpack_q8)
Device: Apple iPhone 15 (private)(iOS 18.0)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 10
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:49:37+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:33:28+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 44.90 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 45.00 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 2.38 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 5.30%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 1.00 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 45.00 ms
  - P90: 47.30 ms
  - P95: 48.65 ms
  - P99: 49.73 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 1.2195
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.1051
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 2.26 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 68.1/100
  - Overall stability rating: Moderate

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows moderate stability (score: 68.1/100) with noticeable
  variation between runs (CV: 5.30%).
  While average performance is acceptable, occasional latency spikes may occur.

  The max/min ratio of 1.22 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 1.11 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
