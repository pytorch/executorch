Latency Stability Analysis: table10 (Primary)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(xnnpack_q8)
Device: Apple iPhone 15 Plus (private)(iOS 17.4.1)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 10
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:49:37+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:33:28+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 40.60 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 39.50 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 4.30 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 10.59%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 4.75 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 39.50 ms
  - P90: 43.80 ms
  - P95: 47.40 ms
  - P99: 50.28 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 1.3784
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.2729
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 5.24 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 38.4/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 38.4/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 10.59%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The max/min ratio of 1.38 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 1.27 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
