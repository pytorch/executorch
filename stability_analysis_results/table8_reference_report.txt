Latency Stability Analysis: table8 (Reference)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(xnnpack_q8)
Device: Samsung Galaxy S22 5G(Android 13)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 21
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:33:43+00:00 to 2025-06-17 17:05:10+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 2.77 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 2.39 ms
  - Mean trimmed latency: 2.50 ms
  - Median trimmed latency: 2.28 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 0.70 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 25.21%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 0.98 ms
  - Trimmed standard deviation: 0.56 ms
  - Trimmed coefficient of variation: 22.28%

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 2.39 ms
  - P90: 3.94 ms
  - P95: 4.01 ms
  - P99: 4.15 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 1.9309
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.7381
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 0.71 ms

Intra-Jitter Metrics (variability within runs):
  - Mean trimming effect ratio: 8.83%
  - Max trimming effect ratio: 30.00%

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 19.9/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 19.9/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 25.21%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The significant difference between raw and trimmed means suggests
  considerable intra-run jitter (8.8%) with occasional outliers within benchmark runs.

  The max/min ratio of 1.93 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 1.74 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
