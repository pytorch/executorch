================================================================================
Model: mv3(qnn_q8)
Device: Samsung Galaxy S22 5G (private)(Android 13)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 11
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:15:17+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:06:01+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 1.03 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 1.01 ms
  - Mean trimmed latency: 1.03 ms
  - Median trimmed latency: 1.01 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 0.06 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 6.03%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 0.01 ms
  - Trimmed standard deviation: 0.06 ms
  - Trimmed coefficient of variation: 6.15%

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 1.01 ms
  - P90: 1.02 ms
  - P95: 1.12 ms
  - P99: 1.20 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 1.2079
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.1881
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 0.07 ms

Intra-Jitter Metrics (variability within runs):
  - Mean trimming effect ratio: 0.36%
  - Max trimming effect ratio: 0.98%

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 62.5/100
  - Overall stability rating: Moderate

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows moderate stability (score: 62.5/100) with noticeable
  variation between runs (CV: 6.03%).
  While average performance is acceptable, occasional latency spikes may occur.

  The max/min ratio of 1.21 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 1.19 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
