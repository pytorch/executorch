Latency Stability Analysis: table6 (Primary)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(mps)
Device: Apple iPhone 15 Pro (private)(iOS 18.4.1)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 8
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 09:33:04+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:33:28+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 2.88 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 3.00 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 0.35 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 12.30%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 0.00 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 3.00 ms
  - P90: 3.00 ms
  - P95: 3.00 ms
  - P99: 3.00 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 1.5000
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.0000
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 0.45 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 43.8/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 43.8/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 12.30%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The max/min ratio of 1.50 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.
