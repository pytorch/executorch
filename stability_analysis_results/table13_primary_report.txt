================================================================================
Model: mv3(xnnpack_q8)
Device: Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G (private)(Android 14)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 10
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:15:17+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:06:01+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 2.98 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 2.52 ms
  - Mean trimmed latency: 2.73 ms
  - Median trimmed latency: 2.28 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 1.17 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 39.37%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 0.14 ms
  - Trimmed standard deviation: 1.06 ms
  - Trimmed coefficient of variation: 38.80%

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 2.52 ms
  - P90: 4.01 ms
  - P95: 5.06 ms
  - P99: 5.89 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 2.6068
  - P99/P50 ratio: 2.3378
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 0.77 ms

Intra-Jitter Metrics (variability within runs):
  - Mean trimming effect ratio: 8.13%
  - Max trimming effect ratio: 12.69%

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 4.9/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 4.9/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 39.37%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The significant difference between raw and trimmed means suggests
  considerable intra-run jitter (8.1%) with occasional outliers within benchmark runs.

  The max/min ratio of 2.61 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 2.34 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
