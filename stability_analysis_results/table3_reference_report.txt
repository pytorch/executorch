Latency Stability Analysis: table3 (Reference)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(mps)
Device: Apple iPhone 15(iOS 18.0)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 6
  - Date range: 2025-06-12 03:49:34+00:00 to 2025-06-17 03:03:25+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 3.33 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 4.00 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 1.03 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 30.98%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 1.50 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 4.00 ms
  - P90: 4.00 ms
  - P95: 4.00 ms
  - P99: 4.00 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 2.0000
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.0000
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 0.89 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 37.5/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 37.5/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 30.98%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The max/min ratio of 2.00 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.
