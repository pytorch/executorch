Latency Stability Analysis: table11 (Primary)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(xnnpack_q8)
Device: Apple iPhone 15 Pro (private)(iOS 18.4.1)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 10
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 01:49:37+00:00 to 2025-06-12 17:33:28+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 16.20 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 14.50 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 6.16 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 38.03%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 8.75 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 14.50 ms
  - P90: 23.20 ms
  - P95: 24.10 ms
  - P99: 24.82 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 3.1250
  - P99/P50 ratio: 1.7117
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 6.10 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 7.2/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 7.2/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 38.03%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The max/min ratio of 3.12 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 1.71 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
