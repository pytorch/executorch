Latency Stability Analysis: table6 (Reference)
================================================================================
Model: mv3(xnnpack_q8)
Device: Apple iPhone 15(iOS 18.0)

Dataset Overview:
  - Number of samples: 7
  - Date range: 2025-06-11 03:17:41+00:00 to 2025-06-17 03:03:25+00:00

Central Tendency Metrics:
  - Mean latency: 52.71 ms
  - Median latency (P50): 47.00 ms

Dispersion Metrics:
  - Standard deviation: 21.83 ms
  - Coefficient of variation (CV): 41.41%
  - Interquartile range (IQR): 13.00 ms

Percentile Metrics:
  - P50 (median): 47.00 ms
  - P90: 73.60 ms
  - P95: 86.80 ms
  - P99: 97.36 ms

Inter-Jitter Metrics (variability between runs):
  - Max/Min ratio: 2.6316
  - P99/P50 ratio: 2.0715
  - Mean rolling std (window=5): 19.97 ms

Stability Assessment:
  - Overall stability score: 4.6/100
  - Overall stability rating: Poor

Interpretation:
  The benchmark shows poor stability (score: 4.6/100) with significant
  variation between runs (CV: 41.41%).
  Performance is unpredictable and may lead to inconsistent user experience.

  The max/min ratio of 2.63 indicates
  substantial performance differences between the best and worst runs.

  The P99/P50 ratio of 2.07 suggests
  occasional latency spikes that could affect tail latency sensitive applications.
