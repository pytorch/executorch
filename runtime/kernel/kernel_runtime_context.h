 * forwarded to operators if running in ATen mode as those operators do not
 * expect to receive a KernelRuntimeContext and would not use it.
 *
 * This includes things like setting an error state, a scratch allocator for
 * operators that need more then constant space, and a TensorResizer for dynamic
 * shape tensors allowing programs to be more flexible with Tensor shape.
