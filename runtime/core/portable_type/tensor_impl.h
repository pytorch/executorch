/**
 * Manages the storage behind an ETensor (torch::executor::Tensor).
 *
 * Note that instances of this class do not own the arrays given to it
 * (sizes/strides/data), which means that the caller must guarantee that they
 * live longer than a given instance of this class.
 *
 * Note on types:
 *
 * Code that uses ETensor should also be able to build against at::Tensor. So,
 * although the overlapping APIs don't need to be exactly the same, their types
 * should be semantically similar.
 *
 * Many of the methods in at::Tensor use int64_t for parameter and return types.
 * This can be a waste when building for 32-bit environments. So, TensorImpl and
 * ETensor use ssize_t instead: like int64_t it is signed, but it will match the
 * native word size of the target architecture. This will avoid unnecessarily
 * expensive uses of 64-bit integers on 32-bit machines.
 *
 * But, since the types are not identical, code that uses ETensor needs to be
 * generic about the local types it uses when working with these methods. In
 * most cases, `auto` will do the trick. In the worst case, code can be guarded
 * with `#ifdef USE_ATEN_LIB`.
