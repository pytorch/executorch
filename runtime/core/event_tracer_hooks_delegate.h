/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file contains the hooks that can be used by runtime delegate backend
 * authors to log profiling and debugging events from backend code. In order to
 * use these hooks delegate authors would have needed to generate a delegate
 * debug identifier mapping using the DelegateMappingBuilder library present in
 * executorch/exir/backend/utils.py. The delegate debug identifiers generated by
 * that library are the ones that need to be passed to these hooks to log
 * events. Using any other identifiers will cause post-processing of the events
 * data to not properly link back to the nodes in the original lowered graph.
 *
 * The benefit of defining these hooks is that we can easily control whether or
 * not we want to compile in the EventTracer code based on the status of the
 * ET_EVENT_TRACER_ENABLED flag.
