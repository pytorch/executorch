/**
 * Represent a reference to an array (0 or more elements
 * consecutively in memory), i.e. a start pointer and a length.  It allows
 * various APIs to take consecutive elements easily and conveniently.
 *
 * This class does not own the underlying data, it is expected to be used in
 * situations where the data resides in some other buffer, whose lifetime
 * extends past that of the Span.
 *
 * Span and ArrayRef are extrememly similar with the difference being ArrayRef
 * views a list of constant elements and Span views a list of mutable elements.
 * Clients should decide between the two based on if the list elements for their
 * use case should be mutable.
 *
 * This is intended to be trivially copyable, so it should be passed by
 * value.
