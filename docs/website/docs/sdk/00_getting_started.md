# Getting started

The ExecuTorch SDK is designed to provide ExecuTorch users with the tooling they need to profile, debug and visualize models that they have onboarded onto ExecuTorch.

The fundamental features that the SDK provides today is:
- Visualization of models based on the exported graphs in various dialects (ATen, Edge etc.)
- Correlating and displaying the performance data along with the graph visualizations in TensorBoard
- Tabular rendering of all performance data in TensorBoard
- Command line tooling available to dive deeper into graph modules and performance data
- E2E runs on AIBench with direct pointers to TensorBoard visualization on the job results page.

### SDK entry points:

We primarily offer two entry points into the SDK tooling shown below:

- **Python API & CLI tools** - With an ETrecord and an optional ETdump users will be able to leverage all the SDK tooling such as generating a TensorBoard visualization or digging into performance data via the Python API's we provide or also via our CLI utility.

- **AIBench** - With an ETrecord users can benchmark their model on devices in the AIBench lab. We'll behind the scenes generate an ETdump for you with all the performance data, retrieve it from the device and then display the corresponding URL on the AIBench job result page that the users can open for graph and performance data visualization.

## SDK tutorials:
The SDK tutorial is overall broken into the following components:

- [Generating an ETrecord](./01_generating_etrecord.md)
- [Generating an ETdump](./02_generating_etdump.md)
- [Library and CLI](./03_using_sdk_cli_tools.md)
- [Visualizing models along with performance data](./04_visualizing_models.mdx)
- [Debugging with ETDB](./05_ETDB.md)
- [Using AIBench to profile and visualize models](./06_aibench_sdk.md)

## SDK fundamentals:
Before we dive into to understand how to use the tooling let's understand some fundamental components of the SDK that are integral for fully leveraging all the functionality it provides. These are:

- **ETrecord**
- **ETdump**


### ETrecord:


ETrecord is intended to be the debug artifact that is generated by users ahead of time. To draw a rough equivalent to conventiona; software development ETrecord can be considered as the binary built with debug symbols that is used for debugging in gdb.

When generating an ETrecord the user will be expected to provide the graph modules that they are interested in working with via our tooling. The user can also provide their ExecuTorch program to store in ETrecord which can then later also be used to run the actual model on device or anywhere the user intends to. Further details on how to generate an ETrecord are provided in the ETrecord section.


### ETdump


ETdump is the serialized object that is generated by the runtime after running a model. Similarly as above to draw a rough equivalent to conventional software development ETdump could be considered as the coredump of ExecuTorch, but in this case within ETdump we store all the performance and debug data that was generated by the runtime.

ETdump is then provided to our tooling to visualize the performance and debug data generated by the runtime. When ETdump and ETrecord are both passed to our tooling we are able to correlate this performance and debug data with the corresponding nodes in the graph that generated them.

*** NOTE:*** If you only want to visualize the graph then you don't need an ETDump. You will only need an ETDump if you want to visualize the graph along with model performance and debug data.
