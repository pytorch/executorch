# Using AIBench along with the SDK

AIBench is a benchmarking framework used to execute binaries on-device and collect output. It's an intuitive tool for on-device workloads, including testing, benchmarking ML models, measuring PyTorch operator performance, and scheduling continuous benchmark runs.
Get started at the [AIBench wiki](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/wiki/AIBench/Mobile_Overview/Submitting_a_Job/)

If you're interested in benchmarking your model on a device using AIBench and then visualizing the performance data along with the model visualization then the `ExecutorchAIBenchAPI` is your one-stop solution for all of this.

AIBench handles all of the plumbing required to generate an ETdump and also to subsequently generate the visualization along with the performance data.
Pass in the ETRecord (please refer to [this page](./01_generating_etrecord.md) for instructions on how to generate en ETrecord) along with your device selection to the `ExecutorchAIBenchAPI`.

Behind the scenes we will then run your model on the device you selected, fetch the etdump that was generated by the runtime, generate the visualization along with the performance data visualization on a TensorBoard and the link to this will be populated on the AIBench Job Result page.

### Sample Notebook:
A sample notebook that goes through the entire flow of generating an ETRecord and then running an AIBench job using that. [Link](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/anp/view/?id=3799219)

### Visualization and ETDump links in AIBench job result page:
As shown in the image below you can click on the link that says "Open etdump.etdp in TensorBoard" which will take you to the TensorBoard page with the visualization.

Alternatively if you wish to you can also download the etdump from the link thay says "etdump.etdp" and use it in our command line tooling.
