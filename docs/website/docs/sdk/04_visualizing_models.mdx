# Visualizing models along with performance data

Visualization of models in the ExecuTorch SDK is done using TensorBoard. The process to generate the visualization of a model can be broadly broken down into three steps.

1. Generate an etrecord with the exported graph modules of your model that you want to visualize. Refer to the [etrecord tutorial](./01_generating_etrecord.md) for more details on how to do this.

2. *Optionally* generate an etdump to also visualize the performance data of your model run along with the graph. Refer to the [etdump tutorial](./02_generating_etdump.md) for more details on how to do this.

3. Generate a TensorBoard url by calling a `visualize_etrecord` API, passing in the ETrecord you generated in step 1 and also the optional ETdump you generated in step 2. This will return a url that you can open in your browser to visualize the model and view the performance data. See [library documentation](./03_using_sdk_cli_tools.md) for API details

Here's a video tutorial walking through all the features we have support for in our visualization integration with TensorBoard.
