# ExportDB

ExportDB is a [centralized]
(https://pytorch.org/docs/main/generated/exportdb/index.html) dataset for
recording working and non working export usage examples.

We try to cover a lot of corner cases from PyTorch and Python so that users can
have a better understanding of the capabilities and caveats of export, by
browsing the example database. We also expect that errors that arise during
export will have actionable messages that point to examples in this database.
