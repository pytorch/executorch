<h1> ExportDB </h1>

ExportDB is a [centralized] (https://pytorch.org/docs/main/generated/exportdb/index.html) dataset for recording working and non working export usage examples.

We try to cover a lot of corner cases from PyTorch and Python so that users can have a better understanding of the capabilities and caveats of export, by browsing the example database. We also expect that errors that arise during export will have actionable messages that point to examples in this database.
