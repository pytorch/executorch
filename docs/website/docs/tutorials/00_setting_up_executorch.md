# Setting up Executorch

This is a tutorial for building and installing Executorch from the GitHub repository.

## AOT Setup [(Open on Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m8iU4y7CRVelnnolK3ThS2l2gBo7QnAP#scrollTo=1o2t3LlYJQY5)

This will install an `executorch` pip package to your conda environment and
allow you to export your PyTorch model to a flatbuffer file using ExecuTorch.

### Step 1: Set up a dev environment

To install conda, you can look at the
[conda installation guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

```bash
conda create -yn executorch python=3.10.0
conda activate executorch

conda install -c conda-forge flatbuffers
```

Setting up PyTorch
```bash
# Install the nightly builds
# Note: if you are behind a firewall an appropriate proxy server must be setup
# for all subsequent steps.
TORCH_VERSION=2.1.0.dev20230810
pip install --force-reinstall --pre torch=="${TORCH_VERSION}" -i https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

When getting a new version of the executorch repo (via clone, fetch, or pull),
you may need to re-install a new version the PyTorch nightly pip package. The
`TORCH_VERSION` value in this document will be the correct version for the
corresponsing version of the repo.

### Step 2: Install the `executorch` pip package

This will install an  `executorch` pip package to your conda environment.

```bash
# Do one of these, depending on how your auth is set up
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
git clone git@github.com:pytorch/executorch.git

# Install the pip package
cd executorch
pip install .
```

### Step 3: Generate a program file from an `nn.Module`

Via python script:
```bash
# Creates the file `add.pte`
python3 -m examples.export.export_example --model_name="add"

# Creates the delegated program `composite_model.pte`, other options are "whole" and "partition"
python3 -m examples.export.export_and_delegate --option "composite"
```

Or via python interpreter:
```python
$ python3
>>> import executorch.exir as exir
>>> from executorch.exir.tests.models import Mul
>>> m = Mul()
>>> print(exir.capture(m, m.get_random_inputs()).to_edge())
>>> open("add.pte", "wb").write(exir.capture(m, m.get_random_inputs()).to_edge().to_executorch().buffer)
```

## Runtime Setup

### Step 1: Install buck2

- If you don't have the `zstd` commandline tool, install it with `pip install zstd`
- Download a prebuilt buck2 archive for your system from https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/2023-07-18
- Decompress with the following command (filename depends on your system)

```bash
# For example, buck2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.zst
zstd -cdq buck2-DOWNLOADED_FILENAME.zst > /tmp/buck2 && chmod +x /tmp/buck2
```

You may want to copy the `buck2` binary into your `$PATH` so you can run it as `buck2`.

### Step 2: Clone the `executorch` repo

Clone the repo if you haven't already.

```bash
# Do one of these, depending on how your auth is set up
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
git clone git@github.com:pytorch/executorch.git
```

Ensure that git has fetched the submodules. This is only necessary after
cloning.

```bash
cd executorch
git submodule update --init
```

### Step 3: Build a binary

`executor_runner` is an example wrapper around executorch runtime which includes all the operators and backends

```bash
/tmp/buck2 build //examples/executor_runner:executor_runner --show-output
```

The `--show-output` flag will print the path to the executable if you want to run it directly.

If you run into `Stderr: clang-14: error: invalid linker name in argument '-fuse-ld=lld'`, do
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge lld
```

### Step 3: Run a binary

```bash
# add.pte is the program generated from export_example.py during AOT Setup Step 3
/tmp/buck2 run //examples/executor_runner:executor_runner -- --model_path add.pte

# To run a delegated model
/tmp/buck2 run //examples/executor_runner:executor_runner -- --model_path composite_model.pte
```

or execute the binary directly from the `--show-output` path shown when building.

```bash
./buck-out/.../executor_runner --model_path add.pte
```

## More examples

The `executorch/examples` directory contains useful scripts with a guide to lower and run
popular models like MobileNetv2 on Executorch.
