# Using ExecuTorch with C++

In order to support a wide variety of devices, from high-end mobile phones down to tiny embedded systems, ExecuTorch provides an API surface with a high degree of customizability. The C++ APIs expose advanced configuration options, such as controlling memory allocation, placement, and data loading. To meet the needs of both application and embedded programming, ExecuTorch provides a low-level, highly-customizable core set of APIs, and set of high-level extensions, which abstract away many of the low-level details that are not relevant for mobile application programming.

## High-Level APIs

The C++ `Module` class provides the high-level interface to load and execute a model from C++. It is responsible for loading the .pte file, configuring memory allocation and placement, and running the model. The Module constructor takes a file path and provides a simplified `forward()` method to run the model.

In addition the Module class, the tensor extension provides an encapsulated interface to define and manage tensor memory. It provides the `TensorPtr` class, which is a "fat" smart pointer. It provides ownership over the tensor  data and metadata, such as size and strides. The `make_tensor_ptr` and `from_blob` methods, defined in `tensor.h`, provide owning and non-owning tensor creation APIs, respectively.

```cpp
#include <executorch/extension/module/module.h>
#include <executorch/extension/tensor/tensor.h>

using namespace ::executorch::extension;

// Load the model.
Module module("/path/to/model.pte");

// Create an input tensor.
float input[1 * 3 * 256 * 256];
auto tensor = from_blob(input, {1, 3, 256, 256});

// Perform an inference.
const auto result = module.forward(tensor);

if (result.ok()) {
  // Retrieve the output data.
  const auto output = result->at(0).toTensor().const_data_ptr<float>();
}
```

For more information on the Module class, see [Running an ExecuTorch Model Using the Module Extension in C++](extension-module.md). For information on high-level tensor APIs, see [Managing Tensor Memory in C++](extension-tensor.md).

## Low-Level APIs

Running a model using the low-level runtime APIs allows for a high-degree of control over memory allocation, placement, and loading. This allows for advanced use cases, such as placing allocations in specific memory banks or loading a model without a file system. For an end to end example using the low-level runtime APIs, see [Running an ExecuTorch Model in C++ Tutorial](running-a-model-cpp-tutorial.md).

## Building with CMake

ExecuTorch uses CMake as the primary build system. Inclusion of the module and tensor APIs are controlled by the `EXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_MODULE` and `EXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXTENSION_TENSOR` CMake options. As these APIs may not be supported on embedded systems, they are disabled by default when building from source. The low-level API surface is always included. To link, add the `executorch` target as a CMake dependency, along with `executorch_module_static` and `executorch_tensor`, if desired.

```
# CMakeLists.txt
add_subdirectory("executorch")
...
target_link_libraries(
    my_target
    PRIVATE executorch
    executorch_module_static
    executorch_tensor
    optimized_native_cpu_ops_lib
    xnnpack_backend)
```

See [Building from Source](using-executorch-building-from-source.md) for more information on the CMake build process.

## Reference Runners

The ExecuTorch repository includes several reference runners, which are simple programs that load and execute a .pte file, typically with random inputs. These can be used to sanity check model execution on a development platform and as a code reference for runtime integration.

The `executor_runner` target is built by default when building with CMake. It can be invoked as follows:
```
./cmake-out/executor_runner --model_path path/to/model.pte
```

The runner source code can be found in the ExecuTorch repo under [examples/portable/executor_runner.cpp](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/portable/executor_runner/executor_runner.cpp). Some backends, such as CoreML, have dedicated runners to showcase backend and platform-specific functionality. See [examples/apple/coreml](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples/apple/coreml) and the [examples](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples) directory for more information.
