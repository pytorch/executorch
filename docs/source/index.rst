Welcome to the ExecuTorch Documentation
=======================================

.. important::
   This is a preview version of ExecuTorch and should be used for testing and
   evaluation purposes only. It is not recommended for use in production
   settings. We welcome any feedback, suggestions, and bug reports from the
   community to help us improve the technology. Please use the
   `PyTorch Forums <https://discuss.pytorch.org/>`__ for discussion and feedback
   about ExecuTorch using the tag **#executorch** and our
   `GitHub repository <https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/issues>`__ for bug
   reporting.

**ExecuTorch** is a PyTorch platform that provides infrastructure to run
PyTorch programs everywhere from AR/VR wearables to standard on-device
iOS and Android mobile deployments. One of the main
goals for ExecuTorch is to enable wider customization and deployment
capabilities of the PyTorch programs.

ExecuTorch heavily relies on such PyTorch technologies as `torch.compile
<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler.html>`__ and `torch.export
<https://pytorch.org/docs/main/export.html>`__. If you are not familiar with
these APIs, you might want to read about them in the PyTorch documentation
before diving into the ExecuTorch documentation.
