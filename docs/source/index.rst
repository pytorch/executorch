Welcome to the ExecuTorch Documentation
=======================================

**ExecuTorch** is a PyTorch platform that provides infrastructure to run
PyTorch programs everywhere from AR/VR wearables to standard on-device
iOS and Android mobile deployments. One of the main
goals for ExecuTorch is to enable wider customization and deployment
capabilities of the PyTorch programs.

ExecuTorch heavily relies on such PyTorch technologies as TorchDynamo
and torch.export. If you are not familiar with these APIs, you might want
to read about them in the PyTorch documentation before diving into
the ExecuTorch documentation.

Features described in this documentation are classified by release status:

  *Stable:*  These features will be maintained long-term and there should
  generally be no major performance limitations or gaps in documentation.
  We also expect to maintain backwards compatibility (although
  breaking changes can happen and notice will be given one release ahead
  of time).

  *Beta:*  These features are tagged as Beta because the API may change based on
  user feedback, because the performance needs to improve, or because
  coverage across operators is not yet complete. For Beta features, we are
  committing to seeing the feature through to the Stable classification.
  We are not, however, committing to backwards compatibility.

  *Prototype:*  These features are typically not available as part of
  binary distributions like PyPI or Conda, except sometimes behind run-time
  flags, and are at an early stage for feedback and testing.
