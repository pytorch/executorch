Welcome to the ExecuTorch Documentation
=======================================

.. important::
   This is an alpha release; the ExecuTorch APIs and the ``.pte`` binary format
   may change in incompatible ways before stabilizing in a future beta release.
   When deploying models, we currently recommend using a version of the runtime
   built from the same git revision that was used to generate the ``.pte`` file.
   Once the format has stabilized, this will no longer be necessary.

   We welcome any feedback, suggestions, and bug reports from the community
   to help us improve the technology. Please use the `PyTorch Forums
   <https://discuss.pytorch.org/c/executorch>`__ for discussion and feedback
   about ExecuTorch using the **ExecuTorch** category, and our `GitHub
   repository <https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/issues>`__ for bug
   reporting.

     <div class="et-page-column1"><p><strong>ExecuTorch</strong> is a PyTorch platform that provides infrastructure to run PyTorch programs everywhere from AR/VR wearables to standard on-device iOS and Android mobile deployments. One of the main goals for ExecuTorch is to enable wider customization and deployment capabilities of the PyTorch programs.</p>
     <p>ExecuTorch heavily relies on such PyTorch technologies as <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler.html">torch.compile</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/main/export.html">torch.export</a>. If you are not familiar with these APIs, you might want to read about them in the PyTorch documentation before diving into the ExecuTorch documentation.</p></div>
