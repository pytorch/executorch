# Exporting to ExecuTorch

One of the important steps in getting your PyTorch programs ready for execution
on an edge device is exporting them. This is achieved through the use of a
PyTorch API called `torch.export`.

The `torch.export` documentation, which is part of the PyTorch core library, can
be found in the Core PyTorch documentation set. Additionally, we provide a
step-by-step tutorial that takes you through the process of exporting a PyTorch
program, making it easier for you to understand and implement the process.

To learn more about exporting your model:

* Complete the [Exporting to ExecuTorch tutorial](./tutorials/export-to-executorch-tutorial).
* Read the [torch.export documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.1/export.html).
