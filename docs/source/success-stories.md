:::{grid-item-card} **Liquid AI: Efficient, Flexible On-Device Intelligence**
:class-header: bg-info text-white

**Industry:** Artificial Intelligence / Edge Computing
**Hardware:** CPU via PyTorch ExecuTorch
**Impact:** 2× faster inference, lower latency, seamless multimodal deployment

Liquid AI builds foundation models that make AI work where the cloud can't. In its LFM2 series, the team uses PyTorch ExecuTorch within the LEAP Edge SDK to deploy high-performance multimodal models efficiently across devices. ExecuTorch provides the flexibility to support custom architectures and processing pipelines while reducing inference latency through graph optimization and caching. Together, they enable faster, more efficient, privacy-preserving AI that runs entirely on the edge.

:::{grid-item-card} **PrivateMind: Complete Privacy with On-Device AI**
:class-header: bg-warning text-white

**Industry:** Privacy & Personal Computing
**Hardware:** iOS & Android Devices
**Impact:** 100% on-device processing

PrivateMind delivers a fully private AI assistant using ExecuTorch's .pte format. Built with React Native ExecuTorch, it supports LLaMA, Qwen, Phi-4, and custom models with offline speech-to-text and PDF chat capabilities.

:::{grid-item-card} **NimbleEdge: On-Device Agentic AI Platform**
:class-header: bg-danger text-white

**Industry:** AI Infrastructure
**Hardware:** iOS & Android Devices
**Impact:** 30% higher TPS on iOS, faster time-to-market with Qwen/Gemma models

NimbleEdge successfully integrated ExecuTorch with its open-source DeliteAI platform to enable agentic workflows orchestrated in Python on mobile devices. The extensible ExecuTorch ecosystem allowed implementation of on-device optimization techniques leveraging contextual sparsity. ExecuTorch significantly accelerated the release of "NimbleEdge AI" for iOS, enabling models like Qwen 2.5 with tool calling support and achieving up to 30% higher transactions per second.
