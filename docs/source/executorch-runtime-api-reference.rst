ExecuTorch Runtime API Reference
================================

The ExecuTorch C++ API provides an on-device execution framework for exported PyTorch models.

For a tutorial style introduction to the runtime API, check out the
`runtime tutorial <running-a-model-cpp-tutorial.html>`__ and its `simplified <extension-module.html>`__ version.

For detailed information on how APIs evolve and the deprecation process, please refer to the `ExecuTorch API Life Cycle and Deprecation Policy <api-life-cycle.html>`__.
