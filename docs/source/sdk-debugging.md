# Debugging Models in ExecuTorch

With the ExecuTorch SDK, users can debug their models for numerical inaccurcies and extract model outputs from their device to do quality analysis (such as Signal-to-Noise, Mean square error etc.).

Currently, ExecuTorch supports the following debugging flows:
- Extraction of model level outputs via ETDump.
- Extraction of intermediate outputs (outside of delegates) via ETDump:
  - Linking of these intermediate outputs back to the eager model python code.


## Steps to debug a model in ExecuTorch

### Runtime
For a real example reflecting the steps below, please refer to [sdk_example_runner.cpp](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/sdk/sdk_example_runner/sdk_example_runner.cpp).

1. [Optional] Generate an [ETRecord](./sdk-etrecord.rst) while exporting your model. When provided, this enables users to link profiling information back to the eager model source code (with stack traces and module hierarchy).
2. Integrate [ETDump generation](./sdk-etdump.md) into the runtime and set the debugging level by configuring the `ETDumpGen` object. Then, provide an additional buffer to which intermediate outputs and program outputs will be written. Currently we support two levels of debugging:
    - Program level outputs
    ```C++
    Span<uint8_t> buffer((uint8_t*)debug_buffer, debug_buffer_size);
    etdump_gen.set_debug_buffer(buffer);
    etdump_gen.set_event_tracer_debug_level(
        EventTracerDebugLogLevel::kIntermediateOutputs);
    ```

    - Intermediate outputs of executed (non-delegated) operations (will include the program level outputs too)
    ```C++
    Span<uint8_t> buffer((uint8_t*)debug_buffer, debug_buffer_size);
    etdump_gen.set_debug_buffer(buffer);
    etdump_gen.set_event_tracer_debug_level(
        EventTracerDebugLogLevel::kProgramOutputs);
    ```
3. Build the runtime with the pre-processor flag that enables tracking of debug events. Instructions are in the [ETDump documentation](./sdk-etdump.md).
4. Run your model and dump out the ETDump buffer as described [here](./sdk-etdump.md). (Do so similarly for the debug buffer if configured above)


### Accessing the debug outputs post run using the Inspector API's
Once a model has been run, using the generated ETDump and debug buffers, users can leverage the [Inspector API's](./sdk-inspector.rst) to inspect these debug outputs.

```python
from executorch.sdk import Inspector

# Create an Inspector instance with etdump and the debug buffer.
inspector = Inspector(etdump_path=etdump_path,
            buffer_path = buffer_path,
            # etrecord is optional, if provided it'll link back
            # the runtime events to the eager model python source code.
            etrecord = etrecord_path)

# Accessing program outputs is as simple as this:
for event_block in inspector.event_blocks:
    if event_block.name == "Execute":
        print(event_blocks.run_output)

# Accessing intermediate outputs from each event (an event here is essentially an instruction that executed in the runtime).
for event_block in inspector.event_blocks:
    if event_block.name == "Execute":
        for event in event_block.events:
            print(event.debug_data)
            # If an ETRecord was provided by the user during Inspector initialization, users
            # can print the stacktraces and module hierarchy of these events.
            print(event.stack_traces)
            print(event.module_hierarchy)
```

We've also provided a simple set of utilities that let users perform quality analysis of their model outputs with respect to a set of reference outputs (possibly from the eager mode model).


```python
from executorch.sdk.inspector._inspector_utils import compare_results

# Run a simple quality analysis between the model outputs sourced from the
# runtime and a set of reference outputs.
#
# Setting plot to True will result in the quality metrics being graphed
# and displayed (when run from a notebook) and will be written out to the
# filesystem. A dictionary will always be returned which will contain the
# results.
for event_block in inspector.event_blocks:
    if event_block.name == "Execute":
        compare_results(event_blocks.run_output, ref_outputs, plot = True)
```
