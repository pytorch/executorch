# Setting Up ExecuTorch
In this section, we'll learn how to
* Set up an environment to work on ExecuTorch
* Generate a sample ExecuTorch program
* Build and run a program with the ExecuTorch runtime

## System Requirements
### Operating System

We've tested these instructions on the following systems, although they should
also work in similar environments.


::::{grid} 3
:::{grid-item-card}  Linux (x86_64)
:class-card: card-prerequisites
- CentOS 8+
- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS+
- RHEL 8+
:::
:::{grid-item-card} macOS (x86_64/M1/M2)
:class-card: card-prerequisites
- Big Sur (11.0)+
:::
:::{grid-item-card} Windows (x86_64)
:class-card: card-prerequisites
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with any of the Linux options
:::
::::

### Software
* `conda` or another virtual environment manager
  - We recommend `conda` as it provides cross-language
    support and integrates smoothly with `pip` (Python's built-in package manager)
  - Otherwise, Python's built-in virtual environment manager `python venv` is a good alternative.
* `g++` version 8 or higher, `clang++` version 8 or higher, or another
  C++17-compatible toolchain that supports GNU C-style [statement
  expressions](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html) (`({ ...
  })` syntax).

Note that the cross-compilable core runtime code supports a wider range of
toolchains, down to C++11. See the [Runtime Overview](./runtime-overview.md) for
portability details.

## Environment Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment

[Install conda on your machine](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Then, create a virtual environment to manage our dependencies.
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a conda environment named "executorch"
   conda create -yn executorch python=3.10.0
   conda activate executorch
   ```

### Clone and install ExecuTorch requirements

   ```bash
   # Clone the ExecuTorch repo from GitHub
   git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
   cd executorch

   # Update and pull submodules
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init

   # Install ExecuTorch pip package and its dependencies, as well as
   # development tools like CMake.
   # If developing on a Mac, make sure to install the Xcode Command Line Tools first.
   ./install_requirements.sh
   ```

   Use the [`--pybind` flag](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/install_requirements.sh#L26-L29) to install with pybindings and dependencies for other backends.
   ```bash
   ./install_requirements.sh --pybind <coreml | mps | xnnpack>
   ```
After setting up your environment, you are ready to convert your PyTorch programs
to ExecuTorch.
## Create an ExecuTorch program

After setting up your environment, you are ready to convert your PyTorch programs
to ExecuTorch.

### Export a Program
ExecuTorch provides APIs to compile a PyTorch [`nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) to a `.pte` binary consumed by the ExecuTorch runtime.
1. [`torch.export`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/export.html)
1. [`exir.to_edge`](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/export-to-executorch-api-reference.html#exir.to_edge)
1. [`exir.to_executorch`](ir-exir.md)
1. Save the result as a [`.pte` binary](pte-file-format.md) to be consumed by the ExecuTorch runtime.


Let's try this using with a simple PyTorch model that adds its inputs. Create a file called `export_add.py` with the following code:
```python
import torch
from torch.export import export
from executorch.exir import to_edge

# Start with a PyTorch model that adds two input tensors (matrices)
class Add(torch.nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Add, self).__init__()

  def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor):
      return x + y

# 1. torch.export: Defines the program with the ATen operator set.
aten_dialect = export(Add(), (torch.ones(1), torch.ones(1)))

# 2. to_edge: Make optimizations for Edge devices
edge_program = to_edge(aten_dialect)

# 3. to_executorch: Convert the graph to an ExecuTorch program
executorch_program = edge_program.to_executorch()

# 4. Save the compiled .pte program
with open("add.pte", "wb") as file:
    file.write(executorch_program.buffer)

```

Then, execute it from your terminal.
```bash
python3 export_add.py
```

See the [ExecuTorch export tutorial](tutorials_source/export-to-executorch-tutorial.py) to learn more about the export process.


## Build & Run

After creating a program, we can use the ExecuTorch runtime to execute it.

For now, let's use [`executor_runner`](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/portable/executor_runner/executor_runner.cpp), an example that runs the `forward` method on your program using the ExecuTorch runtime.

### Build Tooling Setup
The ExecuTorch repo uses CMake to build its C++ code. Here, we'll configure it to build the `executor_runner` tool to run it on our desktop OS.
  ```bash
  # Clean and configure the CMake build system. Compiled programs will appear in the executorch/cmake-out directory we create here.
  (rm -rf cmake-out && mkdir cmake-out && cd cmake-out && cmake ..)

  # Build the executor_runner target
  cmake --build cmake-out --target executor_runner -j9
  ```

### Run Your Program

Now that we've exported a program and built the runtime, let's execute it!

  ```bash
  ./cmake-out/executor_runner --model_path add.pte
  ```
Our output is a `torch.Tensor` with a size of 1. The `executor_runner` sets all input values to a [`torch.ones`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.ones.html) tensor, so when `x=[1]` and `y=[1]`, we get `[1]+[1]=[2]`
  :::{dropdown} Sample Output

  ```
Output 0: tensor(sizes=[1], [2.])
  ```

### [Optional] Setting Up Buck2
**Buck2** is an open-source build system that some of our examples currently utilize for building and running.

However, please note that the installation of `Buck2` is optional for using ExecuTorch and we are in the process of transitioning away from `Buck2` and migrating all relevant sections to `cmake`. This section will be removed once we finish the migration.

To set up `Buck2`, You will need the following prerequisits for this section:
* The `zstd` command line tool — install by running
   ```bash
   pip3 install zstd
   ```
* Version `${executorch_version:buck2}` of the `buck2` commandline tool — you can download a
  prebuilt archive for your system from [the Buck2
  repo](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/2024-05-15). Note that
  the version is important, and newer or older versions may not work with the
  version of the buck2 prelude used by the ExecuTorch repo.

Configure Buck2 by decompressing with the following command (filename depends
   on your system, and the location of the binary can be different):

   ```bash
   # For example, buck2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.zst for Linux, or buck2-aarch64-apple-darwin.zst for Mac with Apple silicon.
   zstd -cdq buck2-DOWNLOADED_FILENAME.zst > /tmp/buck2 && chmod +x /tmp/buck2
   ```

You may want to copy the `buck2` binary into your `$PATH` so you can run it
   as `buck2`.

After the installation, you can run the `add.pte` program by following `buck2` command:

```bash
/tmp/buck2 run //examples/portable/executor_runner:executor_runner -- --model_path add.pte
```

Note that the first run may take a while as it will have to complie the kernels from sources
