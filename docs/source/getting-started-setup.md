## Set up Your Environment

Before you can start working with ExecuTorch, you'll need to set up your
environment. This is an important step to ensure that everything runs
smoothly and efficiently. We recommend using `conda` to create and
manage your virtual environment. Conda is a package management system
and environment manager for Python and other programming languages,
which is built on top of the Python package manager pip, and provides
a more convenient and flexible way to manage packages and environments.
In this section, you will set up your `conda` environment and install
the required dependencies.

Follow these steps:

1. If you do not have it already, install conda on your machine by following
the steps in the [conda installation guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

1. Create and activate your conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -yn executorch python=3.10.0
   conda activate executorch
   ```

1. Install the flatbuffers `flatc` command line tool if you do not already have it:

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge flatbuffers
   ```

1. Clone the `executorch` repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:pytorch/executorch.git
   ```

1. Update the submodules:

   ```bash
   cd executorch
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init
   ```

1. Install ExecuTorch and dependencies:

   ```bash
   bash ./install_requirements.sh
   ```

You have successfully set up your environment to work with ExecuTorch. The next
step is to generate a sample ExecuTorch program.

## Generate a Sample ExecuTorch program

After you set up your environment, you are ready to convert your programs
into ExecuTorch programs. You will need to use `torch.export` and the
`executorch.exir` to export your program. Then, you can save your program as
a `.pte` file, which is the file extension ExecuTorch expects. To demonstrate
how to do it, we will generate an ExecuTorch program file from an `nn.Module`.

You can generate an ExecuTorch program by using a sample script or by using
the Python interpreter.

We have created the `export_example.py` script that demonstrates a simple model
export to flatbuffer. This script is available
in the [pytorch/executorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/main/examples/export)
repository.

To generate a sample program, complete the following steps:

1. Run the `export_example.py` script:

  ```bash
  python3 -m examples.export.export_example --model_name="add"
  ```

  :::{dropdown} Output
  ```bash
  Exported graph:
   graph():
     %arg0_1 : [num_users=3] = placeholder[target=arg0_1]
      %arg1_1 : [num_users=1] = placeholder[target=arg1_1]
      %aten_add_tensor : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=executorch.exir.dialects.edge._ops.aten.add.Tensor](args = (%arg0_1, %arg1_1), kwargs = {})
      %aten_add_tensor_1 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=executorch.exir.dialects.edge._ops.aten.add.Tensor](args = (%aten_add_tensor, %arg0_1), kwargs = {})
      %aten_add_tensor_2 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=executorch.exir.dialects.edge._ops.aten.add.Tensor](args = (%aten_add_tensor_1, %arg0_1), kwargs = {})
      %aten_add_tensor_3 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=executorch.exir.dialects.edge._ops.aten.add.Tensor](args = (%aten_add_tensor_2, %aten_add_tensor_2), kwargs = {})
      return (aten_add_tensor_3,)
  Saving exported program to add.pte
  ```
  :::

  This command has created a `add.pte` file that contains your sample program.

Alternatively, you can use a Python Interpreter to perform the same action:

```python
$ python3
>>> import executorch.exir as exir
>>> from executorch.exir.tests.models import Mul
>>> m = Mul()
>>> print(exir.capture(m, m.get_random_inputs()).to_edge())
>>> open("mul.pte", "wb").write(exir.capture(m, m.get_random_inputs()).to_edge().to_executorch().buffer)
```

In this step, you learned how you can export your PyTorch program to an ExecuTorch
program. You can apply the same principle to your own PyTorch programs.

The next step is to run your program by setting up Buck2 and building an
`executor_runner`.

## Building a Runtime

After you have exported your program, you are almost ready to run it.
The next step involves using Buck2 to build a runtime.

**Buck2** is an open-source build system that enables developers to manage
project dependencies easily and efficiently. We will use Buck2 to build the
`executor_runner`, a sample wrapper for the ExecuTorch runtime which includes
all the operators and backends.

You will need the following prerequisits for this section:

* **Zstandard**, or `zstd`, command line tool — install by running `pip3 install zstd`.

* A prebuilt Buck2 archive for your system from [the Buck2 repo](https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/2023-07-18).

Complete the following steps:

1. Ensure that Git has fetched and updated the submodules. This is necessary
   any time commit hash of any of the submodule changes. Therefore, you need
   to periodically sync your submodules with upstream:

   ```bash
   cd executorch
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init
   ```

2. Configure Buck2 by decompressing with the following command (filename depends
   on your system):

   ```bash
   # For example, buck2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.zst
   zstd -cdq buck2-DOWNLOADED_FILENAME.zst > /tmp/buck2 && chmod +x /tmp/buck2
   ```

   You may want to copy the `buck2` binary into your `$PATH` so you can run it
   as `buck2`.

3. Build a binary:
   ```bash
   /tmp/buck2 build //examples/executor_runner:executor_runner --show-output
   ```

   :::{dropdown} Output

   ```bash
   File changed: root//.git/config.lock
   File changed: root//.git/config
   File changed: root//.git/modules
   27036 additional file change events

   …
   Cache hits: 0%. Commands: 376 (cached: 0, remote: 0, local: 376)
   BUILD SUCCEEDED
   ```
   :::

   The `--show-output` flag prints the path to the executable if you want to run it directly.

Now that you have built our sample programs, you can proceed to
run them.

## Run Your Program

After you build your program, you are ready to run it. We will use
the `buck run` command to run our program.

1. Run the binary:

   * To run the `add.pte` program:

     ```bash
     /tmp/buck2 run //examples/executor_runner:executor_runner -- --model_path add.pte
     ```

     :::{dropdown} Sample Output

     ```bash

     I 00:00:00.005954 executorch:executor_runner.cpp:210] 8.000000
     ```
     :::

Alternatively, you can execute the binary directly from the `--show-output` path
shown in the build step. For example, you can run the following command for the
`add.pte` program:

```bash
./buck-out/.../executor_runner --model_path add.pte
```

## Next Steps

ExecuTorch program. Now that you have a basic understanding of how ExecuTorch
works, you can start exploring its advanced features and capabilities. Here
