# Repo and framework name

Refer to the repo/framework/runtime "executorch" (in lower cases) or "ExecuTorch" (in 
camel cases), not "ExecutorTorch".

# Commit messages

Don't commit unless the user explicitly asks you to.

When writing a commit message, don't make a bullet list of the individual
changes. Instead, if the PR is large, explain the order to review changes
(e.g., the logical progression), or if it's short just omit the bullet list
entirely.

Disclose that the PR was authored with Claude.

# Coding Style Guidelines

Follow these rules for all code changes in this repository:

- Minimize comments; be concise; code should be self-explanatory and self-documenting.
- Comments should be useful, for example, comments that remind the reader about
  some global context that is non-obvious and can't be inferred locally.
- Don't make trivial (1-2 LOC) helper functions that are only used once unless
  it significantly improves code readability.
- Prefer clear abstractions. State management should be explicit.
  For example, if managing state in a Python class: there should be a clear
  class definition that has all of the members: don't dynamically `setattr`
  a field on an object and then dynamically `getattr` the field on the object.
- Match existing code style and architectural patterns.
- Assume the reader has familiarity with ExecuTorch and PyTorch. They may not be the expert
  on the code that is being read, but they should have some experience in the
  area.

If uncertain, choose the simpler, more concise implementation.
