    """Registers an implementation of an operator overload group.

    An operator overload group is a set of operator overloads with a common
    operator name. That common operator name should be the base name of this
    target.

    E.g., the "add" operator overload group, named "op_add" in this target,
    might implement:
    - add.Tensor
    - add_.Tensor
    - add.out
    - add.Scalar

    If an op target would like to share a header/sources with a different op
    target (e.g., helpers/utilities), it should declare a separate cxx_library
    and add it as a dep.

    Args:
        name: The name of the operator overload group; e.g.,
            "op_add". This directory must contain a source file named
            "<name>.cpp"; e.g., "op_add.cpp".
        deps: Optional extra deps to add to the cxx_library(). Note:
            - op targets may not depend on other op targets, to keep the
              dependencies manageable. If two op targets would like to share
              code, define a separate runtime.cxx_library that they both depend
              on.
            - op targets may not depend on targets outside of `//executorch`.
              This library is intended to be portable, open-sourceable, and
              self-contained.
        android_deps: Optional extra deps to add to fb_xplat_cxx_library()
            under fbandroid_platform_deps when building for Android, which may
            be outside of //executorch. Note that these will be ignored when
            building for fbcode.

            third-party deps outside of //executorch. Should only be used by
