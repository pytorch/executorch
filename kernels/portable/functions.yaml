# This yaml file contains operators that are also defined by the ATen library.
# For lean mode:
#   - Codegen'd target `executorch_generated_lib` will be reading all the information
#     from this file, including operator schema and kernel metadata.
#   - Selective build target `codegen:executorch_defined_ops` now is selecting all the
#     operators in this file, by dumping all the op names into `selected_operators.yaml`.
#
# For ATen mode:
#   - Codegen'd tagret `executorch_generated_lib` will read information from
#     `native_functions.yaml` in ATen library, for both operator schema and kernel metadat.
#   - Selective build will also look for operator names listed in this file and use them to
#     filter the entries in `native_functions.yaml`. Kernel metadata defined in this yaml
#     will be ignored.
#
# See the README.md file in this directory for a description of the syntax used
# by this file.
