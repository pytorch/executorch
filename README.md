# ExecuTorch
A unified ML software stack within the PyTorch platform for edge devices. It defines new compiler entry points as well as a state-of-art runtime.

## Why ExecuTorch?
Compared to the legacy Lite Interpreter, there are some major benefits:
* Performance wins compared to Lite Interpreter
  * Faster (orders of magnitude lower framework tax in both DSP and CPU)
  * Much smaller binary size, 1.5 MB vs 30 KB without operators.
  * Smaller memory footprint because we do ahead of time memory planning in ExecuTorch and also have clear granular control over where the runtime allocations are done.
* Long term alignment with the direction of PyTorch infrastructure
  * Lite Interpreter relies on TorchScript, which is being phased out; ExecuTorch is the planned replacement for Lite Interpreter.
* Model Authoring & Productivity gains
  * More and better defined entry points to perform model, device, and/or use-case specific optimizations (e.g. better backend delegation, user-defined compiler transformations, default or user-defined memory planning, etc)
  * Ability to lower constructs like dynamic control flow to run on device.


## Design goals
* Minimal binary size (< 50KB not including kernels)
* Minimal framework tax: loading program, initializing executor, kernel and
  backend-delegate dispatch, runtime memory utilization
* Portable (cross-compile across many toolchains)
* Executes ATen kernels (or ATen custom kernels)
* Executes custom op kernels
* Supports inter op asynchronous execution
* Supports static memory allocation (heapless)
* Supports custom allocation across memory hierarchies
* Supports control flow needed by models
* Allows selective build of kernels
* Allows backend delegation with lightweight interface
