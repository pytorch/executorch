# ExecuTorch

**ExecuTorch** is an end-to-end solution for enabling on-device inference
capabilities across mobile and edge devices including wearables, embedded
devices and microcontrollers. It is part of the PyTorch Edge ecosystem and
enables efficient deployment of PyTorch models to edge devices.

Key value propositions of ExecuTorch are:

- **Portability:** Compatibility with a wide variety of computing platforms,
  from high-end mobile phones to highly constrained embedded systems and
  microcontrollers.
- **Productivity:** Enabling developers to use the same toolchains and SDK from
  PyTorch model authoring and conversion, to debugging and deployment to a wide
  variety of platforms.
- **Performance:** Providing end users with a seamless and high-performance
  experience due to a lightweight runtime and utilizing full hardware
  capabilities such as CPUs, NPUs, and DSPs.
