# Releasing New Documentation Version

## Adding docs for a new release

The documentation build in this repository is automated. The documentation "build" job runs on every PR.
The "upload" to gh-pages job runs on tags and the "main" branch.

For any release tag, such as "v1.1.1" or "v1.1.1-rc1", a GH action generates documentation and uploads
it to gh-pages. A directory is created, named after the tag, with the "-rc" suffix, the "v" prefix, and
the number component removed.
For instance, "v0.1.0-rc1" would be shortened to "0.1". Similarly, for the final release tag, such as v0.1.0,
the docs will be uploaded to the 0.1 directory. This allows you to preview your documentation prior to
the official release.

When the first release candidate tag directory for a new release is uploaded to the gh-pages branch,
you will need to manually update the `versions.html` file as follows:

```
<li class="toctree-l1">
  <a class="reference internal" href="0.1/">main (unstable)</a>
</li>
<li class="toctree-l1">
  <a class="reference internal" href="0.1/">v0.2.0 (release candidate)</a> # replace `v0.2.0` with your new tag
</li>
<li class="toctree-l1">
  <a class="reference internal" href="0.1/">v0.1.0 (stable)</a>
</li>
...
```
This adds that new tag to the website dropdown so that the release candidate documentation is available
for the users to preview.

### Updating `stable` versions

The stable directory is a symlink to the latest released version.
On the day of the release, you need to update the symlink to the
release version. For example:

```
git checkout gh-pages # checkout the gh-pages branch
git checkout -b update-symlink-<NEW_VERSION> # create a branch from the gh-pages
NEW_VERSION=0.1   # substitute the correct version number here
rm stable # remove the existing symlink. **Do not** edit!
ln -s "${NEW_VERSION}" stable
git add stable
git commit -m "Update stable to ${NEW_VERSION}"
git push --set-upstream origin update-symlink-<NEW_VERSION> # push the new branch.
```
Go to the GitHub UI and create a PR with your changes against the `gh-pages` branch.
Here is the [sample PR](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/3395). Merge a PR
like that on the day of the release when all binaries are built and published.

### Updating the stable version in dropdown

In addition to updating stable, you need to update the dropdown to include
the latest version of docs.

In `versions.html`, rename (release candidate) to (stable), and remove the
old (stable). Here is an example:

```
<li class="toctree-l1">
  <a class="reference internal" href="0.1/">main (unstable)</a>
</li>
<li class="toctree-l1">
  <a class="reference internal" href="0.2/">v0.2.0 (stable)</a>
</li>
<li class="toctree-l1">
  <a class="reference internal" href="0.1/">v0.1.0</a>
</li>
```

### Adding a <noindex> tag to old versions

You don't want your old documentation to be discoverable by search
engines. Therefore, you can run the following script to add a
`noindex` tag to all .html files in the old version of the docs.
For exampla, when releasing 0.2, you want to add a noindex tag to all
0.1 documentation. Here is the script:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Adds <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> tags to all html files in a
# directory (recursively)
#
# Usage:
# ./add_noindex_tags.sh directory
#
# Example (from the root directory)
# ./scripts/add_no_index_tags.sh docs/1.6.0
if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
  echo "Incorrect usage. Correct Usage: add_no_index_tags.sh <directory>"
  exit 1
fi
find $1 -name "*.html" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i '/<head>/a \ \ <meta name="robots" content="noindex">'
```

1. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch.
1. Create a new branch out of `gh-pages`.
1. Save the above script into a file called `/tmp/add_noindex_tags.sh`.
1. Run against the old documentation directory. For example:
   ```
   bash /tmp/add_noindex_tags.sh 0.1
   ```
1. Add your changes:
   ```
   git add -A
   ```
1. Submit a PR and merge into the `gh-pages` branch.
