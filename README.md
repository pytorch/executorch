**ExecuTorch** is an end-to-end solution for on-device inference and training. It powers much of Meta's on-device AI experiences across Facebook, Instagram, Meta Quest, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, WhatsApp, and more.

It supports a wide range of models including LLMs (Large Language Models), CV (Computer Vision), ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), and TTS (Text to Speech).

Platform Support:
- Operating Systems:
  - iOS
  - Mac
  - Android
  - Linux
  - Microcontrollers

- Hardware Acceleration:
  - Apple
  - Arm
  - Cadence
  - MediaTek
  - Qualcomm
  - Vulkan
  - XNNPACK

Key value propositions of ExecuTorch are:

- **Portability:** Compatibility with a wide variety of computing platforms,
  from high-end mobile phones to highly constrained embedded systems and
  microcontrollers.
- **Productivity:** Enabling developers to use the same toolchains and Developer
  Tools from PyTorch model authoring and conversion, to debugging and deployment
  to a wide variety of platforms.
- **Performance:** Providing end users with a seamless and high-performance
  experience due to a lightweight runtime and utilizing full hardware
  capabilities such as CPUs, NPUs, and DSPs.

## Getting Started
To get started you can:

- Visit the [Step by Step Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/index.html) on getting things running locally and deploy a model to a device
- Use this [Colab Notebook](https://pytorch.org/executorch/stable/getting-started-setup.html#quick-setup-colab-jupyter-notebook-prototype) to start playing around right away
- Jump straight into LLMs use cases by following specific instructions for [Llama](./examples/models/llama/README.md) and [Llava](./examples/models/llava/README.md)
